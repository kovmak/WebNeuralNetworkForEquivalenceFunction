# Equivalence Function Recognition using Neural Network

This project implements a neural network to recognize the equivalence function. The neural network is trained to predict the output based on the given inputs.

## Description

The neural network architecture consists of three layers: two hidden layers and one output layer. Each hidden layer contains two neurons. The activation function used is the sigmoid function.

The training process involves iterating through a set of training data and adjusting the weights and biases of the neurons using backpropagation to minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual target output.

## Usage

To use the neural network:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Enter the input values into the input fields.
4. Click the "Predict" button to see the predicted output.

## Results

The neural network is trained using 10,000 iterations, and the training results are displayed on the webpage. However, it's important to note that the predictions may not always be accurate due to the complexity of the equivalence function and the limitations of the neural network architecture.

## Dependencies

No external dependencies are required to run this project. It can be run directly in any modern web browser.
